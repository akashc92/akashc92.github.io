									<h2>Design proposals for exploring digital well-being.</h2>
									<h3>Stakeholders - Designers of video-streaming platforms.</h3>

									<h3>Sustainable design</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG-20190917-WA0009.jpg" alt="" /></span>Binge-watching videos has become not only a topic of social interation but also an ever-increasing addiction with the availability of easy internet access and ubiquitous computing. Data consumption has drastically increased specifically because of this reason in the last decade. The side effects of such an addiction vary from various physiological effects such as blurry eyes, loss of stamina and increased heart attack chances to psychological effects such as anxiety, depression etc.. With the video content getting more and more compelling each day, season producers are releasing their episodes all at once for people to indulge in, while the algorithms behind the recommended suggestions reinforce the likes and desires of users, making this a vicious cycle of compulsive behavior that gets embedded in the binge watchers viewing habits. We wanted to explore if the design of UI elements had an effect on enhancing the binge-watching behavior among the other known factors.</p>

										<hr />

									<p>The study involved three stages.
									<ol>
										<li>An exploratory study that confirmed the hypothesis, i.e. UI of video streaming apps is responsible for aggravating the binge-watching behaviour.</li>
										<li>A semi-structured open-ended interview meant to reveal novel insights of different types of users on the interface elements.</li>
										<li>Characterization of dark patterns in user interface design related to video watching.</li>
										<li>Design proposals on YouTube that worked as an example for providing a proof of effective incorporation of digital well-being components through semi-intrusive graphical user-interface nudges.</li>
									</ol>

									</p>
									<hr />
									<h3>General survey</h3>
									<div class="box alt">

											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Survey_Correlations.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Initially, a general exploratory survey questionnaire seeking an insight on factors and reasons responsible for augmenting and promoting excessive video watching, conducted on 180 participants, revealed the viewing behaviour of university level Indian population. The questions asked were a mix of objective-type, likert-scale rating based, and subjective-types, seeking self-reporting of participants on their viewing behaviour. A correlation was drawn on the factors promoting binge-watching like content, UI of the streaming platform, psychological factors, contextual factors, social factors etc. with the negative feelings of guilt, anxiety etc. usually followed at the end of a binge-watching session. Around 75 % participants agreed that UI plays at least some part in augmenting the binge-watching behaviour. This gave us confidence to proceed and further research on the exact role of user interface in promoting binge watching.</p>

									<h3>Empirical observations</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/DSC_3653.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>After a thorough psychology literature survey, we came up with a comprehensive framework of knowledge base in behavioral psychology related to digital well-being that was used to exploit the exact elements of user interface design on Youtube and Netflix and the user viewing behavior related thereof, through a semi-structured open-ended interview. To find out detailed insights on the exact triggers in UI that cause a person to watch more than recommended, we took a range of users who varied in their binge watching experience on the basis of time limits in 4 brackets i.e. 1 to 3 hours, 3 to 5 hours, 5 to 7 hours, and 7 hours and more. The users were either asked or shown the exact user interface design instance and asked to reflect on their experiences of binge-watching while doing the interview. The study revealed that features like autoplay, animated thumbnails on hover, recommendations, trending, infinite scroll, skip credits, skip intro, though useful initially, with time induce negative cycles of compulsion by taking away the user autonomy, increasing the fear of missing out, and enhancing choice paralysis.</p>

									<h3>Dark patterns</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Screenshot (77).png" alt="" /></span>A dark pattern, coined by Harry Brignull in 2010, is defined as
									"a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users
									into doing things... they are not mistakes, they are carefully
									crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and
									do not have the user’s interests in mind". We found out that there was a lot of scope to recognise dark patterns in product designs, especially as seen from the end-user behavior in practice. Following in the works of previous activists like Harry Brignull who coined the term dark patterns, we introduced a definition of dark patterns as seen from the perspective of long term behaviour in terms of video watching. We propose that while these features are useful, these features ought to have safeguard measures in long term from a user-centric design philosophy or they should be classified as dark.

									We presented a grave concern for the current state of design of these online platforms as themes like unawareness etc., which were qualities of the user’s
									psychological states or behaviors, led them towards a negative or guilt-laden experience. In the short-term, users enjoy the benefits of convenience, ease of access, and compelling design of the display. However, as participants continually
									mentioned, the long-term effects are mostly ill because of the negative dependencies created by such designs.

									<h3>Design proposals on YouTube</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/horizontal1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Following from the previous studies, we realized the need to come up with design proposals for raising awareness on the minimal costs involved in inculcating digital well-being variables as traded off against engagement variables in interface design, and hence, used YouTube as an example to show how digital well-being can be accommodated in user interface design on video streaming platforms. We defined an exhaustive list of 7 strategies from design feature analysis of previous studies, factors promoting binge-watching and workaround solutions currently employed by users to achieve digital well-being. Each of these seven strategy instances were shown and designed with minimal intrusion to the existing design features of YouTube.</p>

									<h3>Quote</h3>
									<blockquote>Clearly, one can't deny that autoplay is useful, but it does take away the time from you to think what to watch next or whether to watch or not, and when it just starts, you just give in to the choice made for you.</blockquote>
